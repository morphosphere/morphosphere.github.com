### Julia library aimed at simplifying conversion of legacy MATLAB/Octave code into Julia by providing functions similar to MATLAB/Octave



Julia is a new language with a dynamically growing community. It has a lot of syntax similarities to MATLAB/Octave with potential to build higher performance software. Because of this many developers in technical computing consider switching from MATLAB/Octave to Julia. This switch however maybe quite difficult in situations when one has a bulk amount of legacy code running on the daily basis. To simplify to transition of your legacy MATLAB/Octave code we have developed "MatlabCompat" a Julia library with a collection of functions rewritten from scratch under an open source MIT "Expat" license and some are named similarly to functions in MATLAB/Octave.



However, as a word of caution Julia is not MATLAB/Octave and was never meant to be. This library is not meant to substitute any commercial products (including those of Mathworks Inc.), nor is it meant to make Julia language closer to MATLAB/Octave. THe one and sole purpose of this library is to pave a way for enthusiast MATLB/Octave developers willing to engage with Julia open source language. For more information and help please refer to the [Julia language homepage](http://www.julialang.org/)
