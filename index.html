### **MorphoSphere** - Learning about spheroid killing

Cancer is caused by uncontrolled cell proliferation, which eventually leads to life-threatening conditions. Despite of novel treatment approaches, the disease remains a major cause of death worldwide. In order to overcome the often low predictive value of pre-clinical two-dimensional cell culture studies, three-dimensional (3D) tissue models have been developed. Spheroids are self-assembled, organotypic micro-scale tissue mimetics representing healthy or cancerous tissue, depending on the cells they are grown from, providing significant biological complexity. Their behavior is determined by integrating manifold cues from their environment, a complexity, which monolayer cell culture models fail to capture. Extensive studies have been performed comparing efficacy predictions of two-dimensional(2D) compared to 3D cell culture studies proving superiority of the spheroid tumor model. Accordingly, their implementation in antitumor drug testing has been proposed early on. 


The ability of viruses to kill cancer cells has been known for over a century. They ultimately kill their host cell by lysis, wherefore the employed natural or genetically engineered viruses are summarized as oncolytic viruses. Manifold natural and engineered viruses are known to kill cancer cells, but very few have proven successful in the clinics. We aim to use spheroids to answer how oncolytic virus infection affects spheroid integrity and growth, and finally how viruses spread in 3D tissues. 


Continious technological advances allow custom generation of spheroids from an increasing number of tissues and cancers robust enough to perform spheroid-based high-throughput screening (HCS) assays. Moreover, latest cell culture plate developments enable live transmission light (TL) imaging. Based hereon, we have set up a simplified tumor model to understand the parameters controlling oncolytic efficacy of viruses in tumor tissue. Yet, the lack of suitable screening analysis platforms prevents basic and applied research to take full advantage of the spheroid model complexity. That's why we have developed **MorphoSphere** to enable high-throughput screening of scaffold-free spheroids inoculated with different viruses. We employ high-throughput live cell imaging and automatically analyze, quantify and clasify the images by **MorphoSphere**, our newly developed automated deep learning image quantification framework. **MorphoSphere** monitors spheroid dynamics by measuring morphological and textural features. We employ convolutional neural network-based approaches to automatically classify spheroidicity and viability of cell aggregates.

### **MorphoSphere** is open source

Since we expect **MorphoSphere** to be a valuable tool for the automated image analysis generated by any spheroid-based HCS assay, we have put it on [GitHub](https://github.com/morphosphere/Morphosphere.py) for everyone to [use](use.html) or [adapt](develop.html).

### Latest release

**MorphoSphere 2.0** is currently developed and will be released soon. The most recent version of the software is available on GitHub for forking, cloning and download under [GPLv3 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/) from [GitHub](https://github.com/morphosphere/Morphosphere.py).
