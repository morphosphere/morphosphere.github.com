## Software Infrastructure

### **Python**

**MorphoSphere** is written in [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29) 2.7. We recommend installing **Python** 2.7 from [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), since it comes with a number of the standard packages required for **MorphoSphere** and provides a choice of multiple editors. 

### **Anaconda** Installation Guide for Windows (tested on Windows 8.1)

1. Go to <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>. Download **Anaconda** 2.7, chose the "Windows 64bit Graphical Installer" or "Windows 32bit Graphical Installer" depending on your system.

2. Start the Anaconda installation wizard by opening the downloaded .exe file. We recommend to install **Anaconda** directly in C:\\ and for all users. Specify the name of the destination folder that will be created, we suggest "Anaconda27". This will also place a "Python Scripts" folder in C:\\. Make sure to select "Add environment path". Make sure to install the following packages: *XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX list goes here XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX*

3. This step can be omitted if you start your python editor exclusively via Anaconda. Ensure that the environment variables have been set correctly. To test this, open the **Command Promt**, and try to open the Jupiter notebook by typing `jupyter notebook`. This should open a new **Browser** tab with the address <http://localhost:8888/tree>. Otherwise, open the **Edit the system environment variables** manager, note that you need administration priviledges. Select "Environment variables...". Ensure that "C:\ *YourPath*\Anaconda27;C:\ *YourPath*\Anaconda27\Scripts;C:\ *YourPath*\Anaconda27\Library\bin;" is listed in "User variables for *YourAdmin*".

4. Update Anaconda by typing `conda update conda`, followed by `conda update --all` in the **Command Promt**.

### Additional **Python** Packages Installation Guide (tested on Windows 8.1)

In Addition to the packages that come with **Anaconda**, the following **Python** packages have to be installed:

<table class="table table-striped table-hover" style="width:100% text-align:left">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td width="25%">PIP</td>
      <td width="25%">Column content</td>
      <td width="25%">Column content</td>
      <td width="25%">Column content</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table> 

In order to install a package, open the **Command Promt** and type `conda install PackageName`. Replace *PackageName* with the name of the package to install, e.g. *os*.

### Stand-alone **Python** Installation Guide

If you wish to use stand-alone [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/), the following packages are required for **MorphoSphere**. All packages installed are found in the "Anaconda27/pkgs" directory.

<table class="table table-striped table-hover ">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td width="25%">IPython.display </td>
      <td width="25%">numpy</td>
      <td width="25%">ipywidgets</td>
      <td width="25%">natsort</td>
    </tr>
	<tr>
      <td width="25%">os</td>
      <td width="25%">PIP</td>
      <td width="25%">re</td>
      <td width="25%">time</td>
    </tr>
	<tr>
      <td width="25%">Column content</td>
      <td width="25%">Column content</td>
      <td width="25%">Column content</td>
      <td width="25%">Column content</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Introduction to Deep Learning

In **machine learning**, computer algorithms can be trained to autonomously make predictions on data based on using self-acquired training set-based knowledge rather than a priori user-defined strictly static program instructions. For instance, to estimate the value of a property based on the square meters, the number of rooms, the age of the house etc., nicely explained by [Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l42lr8AlrHk). Area, number of rooms or age of the house are inputs for the estimation. Given a number of houses with known values, the algorithm can “learn” based on which of these inputs (or on which combination) the value can be most confidently predicted. This back-propagating weight optimization is referred to as training. The optimal prediction function is a weighted (not all inputs are as relevant as others) sum over the inputs, which in the following can be used to predict the value of a new property. The structure of the computational algorithm is also described by referring to inputs, summing function and outputs as nodes, which are connected by edges representing their weights. Due to the similarities to information handling, processing and communication patterns between neurons in the nervous system, such network-like machine learning architectures are called **neural networks**.

In order to answer more complex questions, one likely needs to add more and more numbers of weighted combinations of inputs called layers, resulting in a deep neural network. Deep neural network are a hierarchical feed-forward cascade of many layers, where each successive layer uses the output from the previous layer as input. Citing [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning), "**deep learning** (also known as deep structured learning, hierarchical learning or deep machine learning) is a branch of machine learning based on a set of algorithms that attempt to model high-level abstractions in data by using a deep graph with multiple processing layers, composed of multiple linear and non-linear transformations." 

In order to automatically classify images (this is a dog, this a cat), again nicely explained by [Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py5byOOHZM8), inputs of the deep neural network need to be features of the image. Image features (edges, corners, textures, shapes, etc.) are extracted by applying different filters on the image, also called kernels. Since these non-linear operations for feature extraction and transformation are referred to as convolutions, deep neural networks solving image-based questions are called **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)**. CNN inputs are thus numerous convolved images of the original image. During the CNN training, the algorithm is provided with a set of example images for each class (10 dogs, 10 cats) and looks for a combination of distinctive features that is unique for each class it was assigned to. How exactly the CNN defines the optimal weights for each convolution in each layer is highly complex and therefore often referred to as “black box”. 

Ever since a CNN-based algorithm won the annual [ImageNet challenge]( http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2016/) in 2012, the concept of CNNs has been attracting a lot of attention. Image classification using CNNs has been shown to be very successful and highly accurate.

### Introduction to the **Theano** Library

Intro text **Theano**

Deep learning in **MorphoSphere** is based on the [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) **Python** library.

### **Theano** Installation Guide (tested on Windows 8.1, 10)

To install the **Theano** library, follow the following steps:

1. Install TDM GCC x64 from <http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/>.

2. In the **Command Promt**, type `conda install mingw libpython` followed by `pip install Theano` to install the **Theano** library.

### Enabling GPU Usage for **Theano** (tested on Windows 8.1)

The training of the CNN is computationally very heavy, we therefore enable GPU usage on our training maschine. Once the CNN is trained and the optimized parameters ar saved, image classification in **MorphoSphere** is significantly less heavy. GPU usage can be enabled on *xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx x, y, z* graphics card. You can enable GPU usage by:
